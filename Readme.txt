About this file

Field names are;
Hs - Significant wave height, an average of the highest third of the waves in a record (26.6 minute recording period).
Hmax - The maximum wave height in the record.
Tz - The zero upcrossing wave period.
Tp - The peak energy wave period.
Dir_Tp TRUE - Direction (related to true north) from which the peak period waves are coming from.
SST - Approximation of sea surface temperature.
