

Observation :
1. there are no NaN values.
2. It seems that value "-99.9" is irrelevant that doesn't help to provide relevant information. We will hence omit that data using column "Peak Direction"
3. the pariplot shows us that the columns are uncorrelated to each other


Conclusion : 
1. We tried to pull prediction on column "Direction", just to see from which wave is pulled into. with an accuracy of 0.12, we dropped that idea.
2. Quiet hard to understand, what shall be the target column. What shall be the framed question
3. The column "Hmax", also, can't be treated as target column.
